# 1. Sum of Elements Up to Target in Matrix
Given an m x n integer matrix where each row is sorted and the first element of each row is greater than the last element of the previous row, return the sum of all elements less than or equal to a given target.

## Problem Explanation ðŸš€
Iterate through the matrix and add elements until reaching one that is greater than the target. Stop early due to the sorted property.

## Logic ðŸ¦¯
* Approach: Traverse row by row, column by column. Stop adding when element > target.
* Own test case: `matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 10` â†’ Output = 26
* Code Structure: Simple nested loops using `vector<vector<int>>`. Libraries used: `<iostream>`, `<vector>`

## Time Complexity and Space Complexity
```cpp
Time Complexity -> O(m*n) worst case, but early break makes it faster
Space Complexity -> O(1)
```

# 2. Valid Anagram
Given two strings, return true if one is an anagram of the other.

## Problem Explanation ðŸš€
Two strings are anagrams if they contain the same characters with the same frequencies.

## Logic ðŸ¦¯
* Approach: Count frequency of each character in one string, subtract using the second string. If counts match â†’ anagram.
* Own test case: `s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"` â†’ true; `s = "rat", t = "car"` â†’ false
* Code Structure: `vector<int>` of size 26 to store counts, loop through strings. Libraries: `<iostream>`, `<string>`, `<vector>`

## Time Complexity and Space Complexity
```cpp
Time Complexity -> O(n)
Space Complexity -> O(1) (constant array of size 26)
```

# 3. Majority Element
Find the element in an array that appears more than n/2 times.

## Problem Explanation ðŸš€
The element that occurs more than half the times is the majority element; always exists in the array.

## Logic ðŸ¦¯
* Approach: Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm: keep a candidate and count, cancel out different elements.
* Own test case: `nums = [3,2,3]` â†’ Output = 3
* Code Structure: Single loop with candidate and count. Libraries: `<iostream>`, `<vector>`

## Time Complexity and Space Complexity
```cpp
Time Complexity -> O(n)
Space Complexity -> O(1)

# 4. Maximum Subarray
Find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum.

## Problem Explanation ðŸš€
Use Kadaneâ€™s algorithm to track current sum and max sum while traversing the array.

## Logic ðŸ¦¯
* Approach: At each step, either extend current subarray or start new subarray; update max sum.
* Own test case: `nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]` â†’ Output = 6 ([4,-1,2,1])
* Code Structure: Single loop. Libraries: `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<climits>`

## Time Complexity and Space Complexity

Time Complexity -> O(n)
Space Complexity -> O(1)

# 5. Pattern Searching
Print all occurrences of a pattern in a text.

## Problem Explanation ðŸš€
Check for the pattern starting at each possible index in the text.

## Logic ðŸ¦¯
* Approach: Nested loops: outer for text start index, inner for pattern match.
* Own test case: `txt = "AABAACAADAABAABA", pat = "ABA"` â†’ Output: indices 1, 10, 13
* Code Structure: Loops and condition checking. Libraries: `<iostream>`, `<cstring>`

## Time Complexity and Space Complexity
```cpp
Time Complexity -> O((n-m+1)*m)
Space Complexity -> O(1)

# 6. Pivot Index
Find the index where left sum equals right sum.

## Problem Explanation ðŸš€
Iterate while maintaining left sum and compare with right sum (total sum - left sum - current).

## Logic ðŸ¦¯
* Approach: Compute total sum first, then iterate to find index where left sum equals right sum.
* Own test case: `nums = [1,7,3,6,5,6]` â†’ Output = 3
* Code Structure: Single loop, integer variables. Libraries: `<iostream>`, `<vector>`

## Time Complexity and Space Complexity
```cpp
Time Complexity -> O(n)
Space Complexity -> O(1)

# 7. Product Except Pivot
Compute product of all elements except the pivot element.

## Problem Explanation ðŸš€
Multiply all elements except the pivot value.

## Logic ðŸ¦¯
* Approach: Loop through array and multiply only if element != pivot.
* Own test case: `nums = [1,3,5,6,2], pivot = 5` â†’ Output = 36
* Code Structure: Loop and conditional multiplication. Libraries: `<iostream>`, `<vector>`

# 8. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
Maximize profit by buying and selling once.

## Problem Explanation ðŸš€
Track minimum price and compute profit at each step; update max profit.

## Logic ðŸ¦¯
* Approach: Iterate array, keep `minPrice` and update `maxProfit = max(maxProfit, price-minPrice)`
* Own test case: `prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]` â†’ Output = 5
* Code Structure: Single loop. Libraries: `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<climits>`

# 9. Roman to Integer
Convert a Roman numeral string to an integer.

## Problem Explanation ðŸš€
Add values of symbols, subtract if a smaller symbol comes before a larger one.

## Logic ðŸ¦¯
* Approach: Map characters to values, traverse string, check next character to decide addition/subtraction.
* Own test case: `"III" â†’ 3`, `"IV" â†’ 4`, `"MCMXCIV" â†’ 1994`
* Code Structure: `unordered_map<char,int>`, loop through string. Libraries: `<iostream>`, `<unordered_map>`, `<string>`

# 10. Segregate 0s and 1s
Sort array so that all 0s are on the left and 1s on the right.

## Problem Explanation ðŸš€
Place all 0s before 1s; simplest approach using sort function.

## Logic ðŸ¦¯
* Approach: Use built-in `sort()` on array; works because array has only 0s and 1s.
* Own test case: `arr = [0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0]` â†’ Output = `[0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1]`
* Code Structure: `sort(arr.begin(), arr.end())`. Libraries: `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`
