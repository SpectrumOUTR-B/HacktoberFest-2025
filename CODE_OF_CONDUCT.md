# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others  
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences  
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback  
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by mistakes, and learning from them
